<p><strong>1.1 Concepts in Art</strong>
Since the beginning of time, artists have been trying to portrait the way they observe the reality. Sometimes, what they do is a mere reflection of what they see (Aristotle called this <em>mimesis</em>, that is, the imitation of life form in art) in which their work portraits something as it is in real life. In this case, the artist function is being a mirror that wants to show you a moment, like in a photography. Portraits and landscapes normally use this technique.
They also can change the forms and figures that we are used to and transform them into something different or challenging. A great example can be Pablo Picasso, which used all kind of geometrical figures to portrait the characters of the paintings. Another example is the Colombian artist Fernando Botero, who normally uses people of exaggerated body weight to send a message to the viewer.
On the other hand, many painters tend to focus on feelings and expressions, either from themselves or from the characters in their work of art. Jackson Pollock, as an example, used to make abstract art by dripping paint and making lines in their paintings that does not have any logic sense, but shows in a metaphorical way the feelings or thoughts of the artist.
So, how is it possible for these artists to express such different things? Well, they have a specific set of concepts that, being combined, can create different elements of art. Now, let’s talk about some of these elements, so you can understand the basic vocabulary of art.</p>
<p><strong>Line</strong>
If we deconstruct the elements of art, the simplest one is the line. It can be defined as “the element of art that is a continuous mark made on some surface by a moving point” (Mittler &amp; Ragans, 2005). To create an image, the artist rely on the line. The way the line is drawn will make a different impact on the viewer. Lines can be vertical, horizontal, curved, diagonal, zigzag, and irregular, among others. As noted by Fichner-Rathus (2007), line can be used to outline and make the shape of something, to show the depth and texture of whatever is inside a painting or to make the illusion of movement inside the work of art.
<strong>Color</strong>
The color used in a work of art can set the tone or the general mood. Does it make you feel sad? Does it make you feel happy? Probably, the feeling is caused by the color used. Color have three properties: <strong>Hue</strong> (The name of the color, such as blue or red), <strong>Value</strong> (The amount of lightness or darkness that is in a hue), and <strong>Intensity</strong> (The brigthness or dullness of the hue).
The color schemes are used to know the different ways a color can be combined. For example,&nbsp;monochromatic&nbsp;(from “mono” one, and “chroma” color)&nbsp;color scheme refers to a one single color, used with different kinds of value. Maybe we can be looking a painting that is all red, but some red can be dark and another a little bit lighter. Analogous color scheme&nbsp;are the colors that are next to each other in the&nbsp;color wheel. For example, red is analogous with the red-orange and the red-violet. Complementary colors&nbsp;are the opposite ones in the color wheel, meaning that putting them together, in a painting for example, while create an effect of contrast and difference. How do you think you would look with a yellow shirt and purple pants?
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/8kTXJjo.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Colors can be divided in <strong>primary</strong> (red, yellow and blue), <strong>secondary</strong> (the combination of two primary colors) and <strong>tertiary</strong> (mixing a primary color with a secondary color). Also, colors can be <strong>warm</strong> (those that refers to warm things, like the red, yellow and orange) or <strong>cool</strong> (those that make us feel cool, like blue, green and violet).</p>
<p><strong>Shape and Forms</strong>
<strong>Shapes</strong> are objects in two dimensions (height and weight), used mostly in paintings. Now, a <strong>form</strong> is “an object with three dimensions” (Mittler &amp; Ragans, 2005), that is height, weight and width. This forms can be found in sculpture or architecture.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ay9NWjH.png" alt=""> 
<strong>Space</strong>
The <strong>space</strong> is defined as “an element of art that refers to the real or implied distance between, around, above, below, and within objects” (Mittler &amp; Ragans, 2005). Space also helps us to differentiate things that are in front or things that are in the background, using smaller sizes if the things are far away (like in real life). The use of the space can tell you a lot about the work of art: Why does the artist choose this set and not another one? Why did he choose to use that perspective? Did the space is balanced? Does it have any equilibrium?&nbsp;
<strong>Texture</strong>
You can feel the texture of the objects using your hands: the silk of a blouse is soft, the wall of your room is hard or a teddy bear can be fluffy. How is this translated to the art? Combining the different elements of art, the artist can create an image that make us believe that, for its appearance, it would feel like it have a texture, even if it is only an image. As we can intuit here, our eyes have a lot to do with this: if something looks like a rock, it should feel like it. To create this effect, the artist would use carefully shadows, lights, different colors and spaces.</p>
<p>Now that we have seen this elements and concepts in art, try to analyze some artwork. What kind of colors does it use? What feelings do the lines transmit? Is there any texture in the image? Try to reflect about the use of the elements and ask yourself why you think the artist made those choices. Remember that in a work of art every element has a <em>raison d'être</em> (a reason of existence), it means that the things portrayed are not there by chance, the artist put them there for a reason. What effect is the artist trying to achieve? Did he make it? How would you have done it differently?</p>
<p><strong>1.2 Iconography and iconology</strong>
In the previous subtopic, you learned all about the elements that conforms a piece of art. Not all of the elements are always present in a work of art and not all of them have the same importance. It varies a lot depending on what we are analyzing. For some works, it can be more important to show a very bright and appealing color than to focus on texture, or an artist can choose to create strange and bizarre forms but ignore the space around them. The artist doesn’t have a special formula to achieve an effect in the viewer, so he can mix the elements to its convenience.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now that we have some tools to analyze, let’s talk about two different lines that, through observation and interconnection, confronts a piece of art and tries to decode its meaning. One is the&nbsp;<strong>iconography</strong> and the other one is the&nbsp;<strong>iconology</strong>. Both are related and you cannot talk of one without the other.
Before reading the explanation, ask yourself this question: how do you interpret a work of art? What elements do you see? Do you think that there is something hidden? Is there a subtle message in there? Try to imagine how things were different 100 years ago and how they are going to be 100 years in the future. Is there any difference of thought?
As you can imagine, works of art are a product of their context. Even if the artist doesn’t acknowledge it, they are making a statement of their time (maybe in an unconscious way). So, to fully understand the work of art, we need to look at its symbols. That is what&nbsp;<strong>iconography</strong>&nbsp;does.
<strong>Iconography</strong> look at what is behind the work of art. It “implies that a written text underlies an image” (Schneider, 2008). For that, we need to unravel the symbols. A&nbsp;<strong>symbol</strong>&nbsp;is something with a different meaning beyond its appearance. For example, if we look at a cross, the literal object is just two lines, horizontal and vertical, superimposed. In Christianity, the cross means the death and sacrifice of Jesus Christ. An inverted cross is a direct reference to St. Peter, who didn’t want to die in the same way of Jesus. In math, if we look at a cross we now is a symbol for a sum. Do you see how the same thing may be perceived in different ways?
In religious art, there is a lot of symbolism. Some of it is used to differentiate the paintings of the saints. For example, John the Evangelist is shown as a young man, Joan of Arc with an armor, and Saint Augustine with a burning heart. The painting is not telling you directly whom these people are, but if you know the context and the symbols, you can know it. It’s like the image of the death: a human skeleton dressed in black, carrying a sickle. We know that’s the death not because of its literal meaning, but because all the elements symbolize the ending of life.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<strong>Iconology</strong>&nbsp;is about the origin and interpretation of an image (González, 1989). In order to understand a work of art at an iconological level, you must know the context in where it was born. Investigate and do some research: Where is it from? What was happening in the world at that moment? What artists made an influence in the painter? Then, you can create an interpretation that will be more accurate and reliable.
Why do we need the iconological level? If we look at a painting like&nbsp;<em>The death of Marat</em>, by French artist Jacques-Louis David, we see only a dead man in a bathtub. Is there anything else there? If we ignore the context, the painting can be a very simple one. However if we do a little research, we can find who this Marat was and his importance in the development of the French Revolution. Then, the painting is going to acquire a whole new meaning and our interpretation will be more close to the truth. The more we know about the context and art, the more accurate our interpretation will be.
This also can be a little bit tricky sometimes. If we did a lot into the context, we can attribute things to the painting that are not there. We should be careful and not to try to overanalyze things. That’s why, when we are talking about art, we need to have a lot of references to backup what we are saying.
Understanding the symbols, the “text” behind an image, means that our knowledge of the piece of art is going to be more close to the actual intentions of the artist. However, the piece of art can also say things that the artist never imagined, because the context and the times also influences the way we look at it. It is not the same if we analyze the same piece now and then in 10 years, because our points of view are going to change on those years, even if we are the same person. So, again, we don’t have a magic formula to make a universal interpretation.</p>
<p><strong>1.3 Methodologies to analyze art</strong>
As you have seen, art is composed from many different elements that interact and influence. Those aspects shape our mind and make us look things in a different light. Our own perception and knowledge is going to be a very important part when we try to analyze a work of art. We know that, in order to make a good approach, we should look at some elements such as line, color, shape, form, space and texture. Also, it is necessary to look carefully to the symbols and the context in which the piece was made (iconography and iconology). But even if we know that, there are a lot of ways and theories that we can use in order to analyze an artwork. Not every theory will fit, so we should see, according to their characteristics, which one is more appropriate. Let’s talk about some of the most known methodologies of art history, according to Schneider (2008).&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Semiology</strong>
Semiology is the study of the signs. According to a Swiss linguistic called Ferdinand de Saussure, every signs have two parts: the signifier and the signified. The signifier is a reference of how is the word written and how does it sound. For example, the signifier in the word “dog” are the letters “d”, “o” and “g” and the sound <em>dog</em>. This can change from language to language, of course. The signified is the mental idea that we have about that word. For example, we can imagine a cocker spaniel dog or a bulldog. This changes from person to person, because everybody has a different conception and idea of the same word, even if it is something concrete as a dog.
Saussure poses some interesting questions with the signified and the signifier. Is there any word that can reflect the “soul” of the thing it represents? Is the relation between both things just arbitrary? Has a universal language ever existed? In art, the question is could be what is the relation between the signifier (the work of art) and the signified (the real world)? An artwork can provide a new meaning just by showing something in a different perspective.
<strong>Study of the lives of the artists</strong>
The study of the biography, or autobiography, of the authors is a very old method that can have some dangers. In a way, we can learn a lot of the motivations, objectives and illusions of an artist and how his art was affected by their context. But, in another way, we can fall in the trap of thinking that everything that he does reflects somehow his life. Knowing the lives of the authors is helpful, but we also need to draw some&nbsp;<br>limits: not because somebody draw the union between men and God, like Michelangelo, means that he is a religious person.
Giorgio Vasari, famous for have written a lot about artists, is an example of somebody that writes in a subjective way in a biography, creating a doubt in his accuracy. About Leonardo da Vinci, Vasari wrote: “his every action is so divine, that, surpassing all other men, it makes itself clearly known as a thing bestowed by God (as it is), and not acquired by human art” (1996). In this case, is obvious we should not take everything literal.
<strong>Psychoanalysis</strong>
Originated by Sigmund Freud, psychoanalysis deals with issues from the past and tries to reconstruct them in the present, creating a new way of seeing your own life. The unconscious, which is what’s inside your mind but sometimes is not perceived or it is “buried”, needs to be revealed in order to understand ourselves, our fears and desires. In order to unravel this, Freud thinks that we need to analyze our dreams, among other things.
Art can reflect a lot of the person behind the work of art: “Because art is expressive, it reveals aspects of the artist who creates it, of the patron who funds it, and of the culture in which it is produced” (Schneider, 2008). Have you ever said something unintentionally? Maybe like expressing a feeling that you have not intended to say? This, according to some psychologies, is our inner desires searching for a way to be expressed.</p>

<p><strong>2.1 Interpretation of History</strong>
When you study the history of art you can learn not only about movements and tendencies (such as Baroque, Renaissance or Romanticism), but also you will know about the way people were thinking and how they offered a solution to their problems, according to the times they lived. You have seen in the previous chapter some methodologies that critics use for analyzing. But for applying those, you need to know a specific set of things, and sometimes to have a major in Psychology or Linguistics. With the help of Art History, you can achieve a more meaningful and complete understanding of the works of art with a simple methodology. You’re going to base your lesson in the methodology proposed by Mittler &amp; Ragans (2005). You need to follow four basic steps in order to analyze art according to history: description, analysis, interpretation and judging.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>
A good description must answer things like who, where, what, when and, depending on the case, why. In this part you need to know everything about what is inside of the works of art. If you look at <em>The School of Athens</em>, by Renaissance artist Raphael, you would notice that there is a lot of people, mostly men, talking among them. If you stay with that superfluous description, you’re going to miss a lot of important details: you need to know something about the people inside the painting, because it is hard to make an interesting approach if you’re going to ignore who those people were. Does the title changes the perspective of the painting? Where are the characters of the painting? Are they in Athens, as the title suggest? What have happened in Athens? Why is Athens famous?
Also, you need to investigate who was the painter, where did he live, what other works of art he did and some general context around the making of <em>The School of Athens.</em> Now that you know this, you can have valid information to support whatever you want to say about the painting.
<strong>Analysis</strong>
What’s next? Is there something to analyze in a formal way (something that you can now just by watching the painting)? The answer is yes. You often look at the style of the artist. What do we mean with style? “<strong>Style</strong> is an artist’s personal way of using the elements and principles of art to create artworks” (Mittler &amp; Ragans, 2005). For example, in music you can hear a particular style of a musician: not just the rhythm but the essence of him. What is unique about your favorite musician? That’s the style: whatever an artist make in a unique and different way.
<strong>Interpretation</strong>
Now that you know about the author of the artwork, the years in which it appeared and the things portrayed on it, you can make an interpretation. <strong>Interpreting</strong> is to read something that is not obvious, making relations between what you know and what you see and trying to create a new message <em>behind</em> the artwork. Interpretation can be tricky sometimes, because if you are not cautious enough, you can see things that are not actually there. Always prove what you are saying with facts.
For example, you can look at <em>The young ladies of Avignon</em>, by Picasso. If you investigate, you’ll find that the ladies in the painting were prostitutes. Some of them have a mask in their face. An easy interpretation merely from those two facts would be that they were ashamed for their job. Is there any other aspect of the painting that reflects that? If you make a deep search, you’re going to discover that Picasso was also influenced by the Africans masks. With that fact, the relation between prostitution and shame can’t be sustained.
<strong>Judging</strong>
<strong>Judging</strong> something is making a balance between all the things you know by now and decide if there is an important contribution to arts. Sometimes, artists were the first in using or perfect a specific technique, like the tenebrism by Caravaggio. Maybe you’re asking yourself: how can I know, if I am not an art critic, if a work is important or not? Well, you can use the method of art criticism and looking at the aesthetic views suggested by Mittler &amp; Ragans (2005): the subject view (is the subject easy to identify?), the composition view (are the elements combined? Do they have coherence and organization?), and the content view (does it successfully communicate something?). Ask yourself these questions so you can make a judgment.
The context in which the interpretation is made can affect how the artwork is appreciated and judged as well. Diego Velázquez’s <em>Las Meninas or The Maids of Honour</em> was painted in 1656, but it was not recognized as an excellent piece of art until 1819, when it was contemplated by a bigger audience at the Museo del Prado (Calvo-Serraller, 2014). In addition, a very well-known fact about van Gogh is that he only sold one painting while he was alive (Van Gogh Gallery, 2013). Now, his paintings are sold for millions of dollars: time has given him fame and recognition he never had in his lifetime.
Do you think, by now, that you have enough elements and tools to make a comment about any artwork? Now you need to talk about one of the most influential themes in the art, not only in paintings but in literature, sculpture, architecture and music: religion.</p>
<p><strong>2.2 Culture and Religion</strong></p>
<p>Among many of things that art can express, such as feelings, emotions, and ideas, it sometimes may be bounded with religion. Humanity had always searched for some superior power that created life or an answer to some things that remain a mystery, such as what happen after death, the origin of the universe and the purpose of life.
In different cultures and places, the idea of the existence of a god had been an important one, and there are a lot of stories about events such as how the universe was created, who the first human beings were and the battle between good and evil. Those are called myths. Professor Mary Magoulick, teacher of English and Interdisciplinary Studies at Georgia College, offers this definition of myth:
<em>From the Greek mythos, myth means story or word. Myths are symbolic tales of the distant past (often primordial times) that concern cosmogony and cosmology (the origin and nature of the universe), may be connected to belief systems or rituals, and may serve to direct social action and values.</em>
Myths are not supposed to be real: they are only a way in which people try to establish an early explanation to the world, which would make sense in the context of a particular culture. They created beautiful stories to somehow give a sense of security and meaning to their lives; instead of living in a chaotic and godless world, religion make them think that everything have a reason. Some of the most important gods, to different cultures are Brahman, Vishnu and Shiva (from Hinduism), the Trinity of God: Father, Son and Holy Spirit (Christianity), Quetzalcoatl (Mayan), HaShem (Judaism), Allah (Islam) and Zeus (Greek). Even in the French Revolution, where intellectuals wanted to reject everything related to Christianity, they created some kind of cults, like the Cult of the Supreme Being (<em>Culte de l'Être suprême</em>) and the Cult of Reason (<em>Culte de la Raison</em>).
As Schneider (2008) points out, artists sometimes are considered gods, because they create a new reality. Alberti referred to the artist as an <em>alter deus</em>, latin for “other god,” and Dürer said that artists create as God did. In the Bible, the universe was created by God using the word, similar to what a writer do with their texts, a painter with their paintbrush or a musician with their instruments.
As was mentioned earlier, the justification for the existence of gods is to explain things that remains in a mystery. One of them is the creation of humans: where do we come from? Why did we exist?
We can’t address all the religious histories of every civilization, but you should know that histories from the Bible and Christianity had been a very important theme on paintings and sculptures, especially for the European civilization. Church was a very influential force and was very powerful during a long time but started to lose power when the Protestant Reformation began (when different religions where created, like Lutheranism and Anglicanism), at 1517. Let’s look at two different religious histories.</p>
<p><strong>Adam and Eve</strong>
The Bible says that the first humans were Adam and Eve, and they lived in the Garden of Eden. Adam was created using clay, in the image of God, and Eve was created from a rib of Adam. They were forbidden to eat from a tree in the Garden of Eden: the so-called Tree of the knowledge of good and evil. When they ate from it, they were banished from the Eden. It seems like this is a very straight-forward story but it have been represented a lot of times in art, and every time with a different approach because artists have a unique way of looking at things even if the theme is the same. Some of the most famous representations are the ones from Michelangelo, Jan Brueghel, Hieronymus Bosch, William Blake, Gustave Klimt, Auguste Rodin, Peter Paul Rubens, Massaccio and Raphael.
<strong>La creación</strong>
According to the Mayan story of creation, told in the book <em>Popol Vuh</em>, humans came from the corn, not from clay as in Christianity. _“Our Creation Story teaches us&nbsp;that the first Grandparents of our people were made from white and yellow corn. Maize is sacred to us because it connects us with our ancestors. It feeds our spirit as well as our bodies” (Batz Puac, 2014).</p>
<p>As you can see, religion is something that always come along hand to hand with culture, because it can manifest in things like art, traditions and myths. Religion make people believe in something beyond their understanding, something that controls and arrange our lives and make people more confident about the meaning of things.</p>
<p><strong>2.3 Cultural Heritage</strong> 
You have learned that art and culture are two forces that can’t be separated. If you try to talk about art and leave culture behind, it isn’t going to be fully understood, it’s going to be incomplete. The artist, as you have read before, is a product of their time and, consciously or not, they represent their context. Artists would take what they appreciate from their environment and transform it, maybe into something similar to reality or into something abstract.
Artists are like translators who would use their tools to tell something to the world, some message that cannot be said in any other way. As Chuck Palahniuk (2014) said in his novel <em>Invisible Monsters:</em> “Nothing of me is original. I am the combined effort of everyone I’ve ever known”. The writer have declared that he just listen to the stories of other people and combine them into a novel. That can be the definition of an artist as well: somebody that blends information and observation into an artwork. &nbsp;
Probably, you’ll never know when was the first time that the human being made art, but you can have an idea. You can find manifestations of art from 17 000 years ago in the Lascaux Caves, in France, for example, where some paintings of animals, humans and signs can be found.</p>
<p>There are some legends around how the art was created too:
<em>Ancient traditions trace the origin of image-making to drawing a line around a reflected image or shadow. A Greek legend attributes the origin of portraiture to a young woman of Corinth who traced the shadow of her lover’s face cast on the wall by lamplight. His father, a potter, filled in the outline with clay, which he then fired (Schneider, 2008).</em></p>
<p>This beautiful legend serves to different purposes: it is not only talking about the hypothetical origin of art, but also how art can recreate your memories and so you can have a piece of the past with you. You don’t know anything about the lover of the woman in the legend, but you can say that she surely is going to remember him and all the moments that they were together, thanks to the piece of art.
The cultural context of the artist would be reflected in the work, maybe as religious values, but it also can show nationalist or social aspects. Napoleon Bonaparte, as told by Schneider (2008) adopted the style of the Neoclassical period, in which artists tried to return to the Classical period because he thinks that kind of art would exalt his figure. You can find some paintings from Jacques-Louis David that shows Napoleon in heroic or important moments, like in <em>The Coronation of Napoleon in Notre Dame or Napoleon Crossing the Alps.</em> In this case, art was used to achieve a political purpose.</p>
<h3 id="topic-3"><a class="anchor" name="topic-3" href="#topic-3"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><strong>Topic 3</strong></h3>
<p><strong>3.1 Prehistoric</strong><br>The term <strong>prehistoric</strong> refers to the period of human history before the invention of writing systems. Historians can’t know everything about these times and have to make a lot of assumptions. According to Schneider (2001), the Stone Age, the period in which human beings used tools made of stone until they started to use metal, is divided into three periods:
<strong>Paleolithic</strong> ("Old stone" 1,500.000 BC to 8,000 BC), <strong>Neolithic</strong> ("New stone", 6000 or 4000 BC to 2000 BC), and <strong>Mesolithic</strong> ("Middle stone", 8,000 BC to 6,000 BC).</p>
<p><strong>Paleolithic (c. 1,500,000-c. 8,000 BC)</strong>
The art and culture from this period were the work of the <em>homo sapiens</em>, who hunted using sticks and stone weapons (Prette &amp; De Giorgis, 2002). People on this era were nomads and lived in communities. The objects found from this age were mostly for useful purposes, like weapons such as daggers, harpoons and blowguns: in that way, art (that almost never have a utilitarian end) was a concept that was not grasped yet (Schneider, 2008).
One of the first art manifestations were the paintings found in caves, such as in Chauvet and Lascaux Cave (France), El Castillo and Altamira Cave (Spain) or the Cave of Swimmers (Egypt). The similarities between the artworks on these places are amazing.
Prette &amp; De Giorgis (2002) say that the images of the caves (bison, horses or deers, among other animals) were to explain how to develop a hunting. Gardner (1959) explains how these human beings painted in the caves:
<em>For light they used a tiny stone lamp, filled with marrow or fat and supplied with a wick, perhaps of moss. For drawing they used chunks of red and yellow ocher, and for painting they ground these same ochers into powder, which they blew on the walls or mixed with some medium, perhaps animal fat. A large flat bone served them as palette; they could make brushes from reeds or bristles; he could use a blowpipe of reeds to trace outlines of figures.</em>
Could you imagine this process? Why did they feel the urge to create something like that, even if it was laborious? To whom were these pictures made? What was its purpose? Other people said that maybe it was a ritual in which men tried to understand the forces of nature.
Other art manifestations include sculptures like the Venus of Willendorf, in Austria (dated c. 25,000-21,000 BC), the Venus of Laussel in France (c. 25,000-23,000 BC) and the Venus of Lespugue (26,000-24,000 BC), which is made from ivory and shows exaggerated female characteristics.</p>
<p><strong>Mesolithic</strong> <strong>(c. 8000-c. 6000/4000 BC)</strong>
Mesolithic era was not a very important for the evolution of art. It is considered to be like a bridge between the Paleolithic and the Neolithic. The most significant aspects on this period were the ending of the Ice Age and the development of agriculture and fishing as important activities. Communities started to be settled; being nomads was not necessary anymore.
The few art known from this period is more abstract and stylized. According to Esaak (2014), it is believed that this paintings were some of the first attempts to create a language through hieroglyphs. Art consisted in rock paintings and pottery, and it was not as impressive as the works from the Paleolithic period.</p>
<p><strong>Neolithic (c. 6000/4000-c. 2000 BC)</strong>
The art expression on this time was strongly influenced by the changes in the social organization: people started settling down and the architecture began to be an important mean of expression. Big stones were arranged in certain shapes because of religious beliefs; these rocks are referred as megaliths. There are <em>megaliths</em> in Spain, Italy, Ireland and Britain, among other places.
One of the most popular megaliths from the Neolithic is Stonehenge; it is classified as a cromlech, that means a “circle place”. It is believed that these places were sacred. In this cromlech appears one of the most primordial structures in architecture: the thrilithon (“three stones”), consisting in two vertical stones and one horizontal stone above those (Prette &amp; De Giorgis 2002). It is also called the post and lintel construction.
<em>The Stonehenge consists of an outer ring of immense monoliths capped with lintels roughly cut [...]. Inside is a line of smaller stones; then a broken ring of five pairs of monoliths, each pair with its lintel; and again an inner broken circle of smaller stones, inside of which is a large slab which may have served as an altar (Gardner, 1959).</em>
According to a note from The Guardian (Kennedy, 2013), Professor Mike Parker Pearson discovered 50,000 bone fragments and 63 people buried in Stonehenge, creating the hypothesis that Stonehenge was like a graveyard. Parker Pearson also believes that only special people was buried there.
It is not clear what the meaning of this place was or why it was created. “Druids and New Age followers still claim the site as their sacred place. Others have judged it a temple, an observatory, a solar calendar, a site for fairs or ritual feasting or [...] a center for healing” (Kennedy, 2013). It is difficult to know accurately about these cultures’ beliefs and ideas.</p>
<p><strong>3.2 Egypt</strong><br>In Africa appeared one of the greatest civilizations of all time: Egypt. Settled near the Nile (meaning “river”) river, Egyptians made a lot of contributions to art and society, the pyramids, the mummifications process, the Sphinx and their temples, just to name a few. Gardner (1959) attributes the sense of order and organization to the Nile River: maybe the observation of the river make the Egyptians to create goddess like Maat, who represents balance.
The ruler of the Egyptians was the Pharaoh, a kind of dictator supposed to be an intermediary between the people and their gods. The wife of the Pharaoh, the queen, was supposed to give birth a child to be the heir of the throne, and that was the only function of her. According to Schneider Adams (2001), there are some things that we can be observed about the Egyptian society: The king could have incestuous marriages if it were useful. Families were mostly monogamous and infidelity could cause divorce, especially if it was perpetrated by women. Other causes for divorce were impotence or infidelity. Fertility gods, like Isis, were adored on each home and the main purpose of a marriage was to have children. With that idea, homosexuality was seen as something against fertility.
The <strong>Palette of Narmer</strong> is a palette decorated in low relief. The way in which it is done reflect a reinterpretation of the human body, because it does not try to imitate it: “the body parts are arranged as they are individually understood, and not as they are seen in nature” (Schneider, 2001).
King Narmer appears in this pallete, taking an enemy by its hair, showing his power. Below him, there are two dead enemies. At the top of the palette, there is the name of the king in hieroglyphs (images that represents the words) and the image of Hathor, a goddess that protects the king. Everything that appears in the pallet makes the suggestion that king Narmer was the greatest and most powerful king. You can learn that the image can also send a message: they started to make images that were not exactly like what was portrayed, because its intentions were different.
<strong>Pyramids</strong> are the most famous Egyptian structures. Those were a symbol for the afterlife, the place in which the pharaohs supposed to be buried and have a good life after their death. Pharaoh was mummified and buried with several offerings. When a pharaoh died, the body “was transported across the Nile by boat to the valley temple. It was then carried along the causeway to its own funerary temple, [...] and the Opening of the Mouth ceremony was performed” (Schneider, 2001). This ceremony consisted in taking the mummy of the king and open his eyes and mouth, with the purpose that he could be able to eat and see in the afterlife.
The <strong>mummification</strong> process was very important. The preoccupation of the Egyptians for the afterlife was central in the way they think, so they were extremely careful in those aspects; the entire process last about 72 days. They needed to conserve their body and every material they achieved on earth. All the organs were removed, except for the heart. After that, the body was covered with substance that dehydrated it and dissolved the body fats, then washed with scented oils. The organs were placed in four jars, guarded by the four sons of Horus. &nbsp;
As we can observe by now, many of the things that the Egyptians did were intended to preserve the memory of the glories of the pharaohs. The art served as a reminder that there were somebody that rules Egypt and shall be reminded. Pyramids and mummies were also a symbol of power.
Egyptians <strong>sculptures</strong> also served a similar purpose, creating sculptures only for important people and “the more important the personage represented, the more rigorously the conventions were observed” (Schneider, 2001). An example of that is the statue of Khafre, which is seated in an erect posture. People would go near of this sculptures and offer them drink and food, believing they could transform into the real Pharaoh and eat the offerings.
These, among other things, are the highlights of what we know about them. Egyptian culture is a fascinating one with a lot of visual ideas: the pyramids and sculptures were symmetrical, and they got their own perspective measures. We can look how they care, in an artistic way, to create their own uniqueness and reflect the way they see the world.</p>
<p><strong>3.3 Mesopotamia</strong>
The name of this civilization means literally “land between the rivers”, that’s because it was situated between the Tigris and the Euphrates. Just as Egypt was near the Nile River, Mesopotamia would have these two rivers as a reference. Mesopotamia is well known for creating the firsts monumental temples, irrigation systems, governments based on the city-states structure and the cuneiform writing system (Fichner-Rathus, 2007).
According to Gardner (1959), the gods of the people from Mesopotamia tend to reflect the nature (this was a tradition in all of the first religions). There is Anu (god of sky), En-lil (ruler of the earth), Ea (water), Nannar (moon), Shamash (sun) and Ishtar (love and fertility). Gardner also speaks about the burials; contrary to the Egyptians, Mesopotamians didn’t care a lot about the afterlife: their tombs were not as sumptuous as the Egyptians ones. Priests were an important part of their daily life, because, besides of their religious functions, they also were literate people, which made them very skilled in a variety of things.
Schneider (2001) tells that, in architecture, Mesopotamians create a special building called <strong>ziggurat</strong>, meaning “high”. She explains: “Mesopotamians believed that each city was under the protection of a god to whom the inhabitants owed service, and they built imitation mountains, or ziggurats, as platforms for the god”. The symbol for the power of nature was the mountains, for that reason, they created things that look like it. In addition, ziggurats were a place of transition, not for the afterlife, but between gods and humans.
Mesopotamians also were an important civilization because they created a writing system called <strong>cuneiform</strong> (literally, it means “in the form of a wedge”). This system had evolved from the idea of ownership: they marked things with seal, usually a cylinder with an image carved on it, for example, legal documents. Once the cuneiform system was established, it was a matter of time for the art of literature to be developed.
Mesopotamian literature tried to discover the origin of gods and humans. One of the poems of the time was the <em>Epic of Gilgamesh,</em> considered one of the first representations of epic poetry. Gilgamesh was a powerful king searching for eternal life, and he had to go through a lot of adventures in order to achieve it.
An interesting thing about this poem was that it talked about a big flood, such as other many cultures that have a story about a flood sent by a god to destroy a town or a city. Mesopotamians, hebrews, hindus and mayans have talked about this on their myths. Some scientists even suspect that maybe it existed a great flood in the past. This can lead to ask ourselves, even if we are different, do we have the same inner thoughts?
Mesopotamians created one of the earlier legal systems: the famous <strong>Hammurabi’s Code</strong>, created 1792-1750 BC and rediscovered at 1901 by French archeologists (Andrews, 2013). This code was written by Hammurabi, king of Babylon, and its laws were scripted in a black basalt stele. It was not equal to everybody: punishments were worst for the lower classes than for the upper classes; an offender from the upper class could be just fined, and a lower class offender punished with the Talion Law. The <strong>Talion Law</strong> means that the punishment for a crime should be equal to its consequences, it is often summarized with the saying <em>an eye for an eye</em>.</p>

<p><strong>4.1 Chinese</strong>
China was the center of the art and culture from East Asia, influencing later to civilizations such as Korea or Japan (Swann, 1974). When the army of Qin Shi Huang conquered six other kingdoms (Qi, Chu, Yan, Han, Zhao and Wei), the <strong>Qin dynasty</strong> was considered as the first dynasty with an emperor (Qin himself). This dynasty lasted from 247 to 210 BC. After the Qin dynasty, the modern period of the Chinese civilization started with the Han dynasty, which lasted four centuries: 206 BC to AD 220 (Mittler and Ragans, 2005).
According to Swann (1974), <strong>Taoism</strong>, the philosophical and religious system that intended to create peace with the “Tao", made a huge influence in the way of Chinese government:
<em>It offered them such blandishments as the elixir of immortality or communication with the dead. But at the same time they were shrewd enough to appreciate that this kind of sorcery, even though backed by a primitive church organization, was not an instrument by which they could rule a huge country.</em>
This kind of system could look strange for us, but it was very important for this civilization. The most important poem of Taoism is the “Tao Te Ching” that influenced, with his philosophical way of expressing, the paintings in Chinese art; pottery and literature were influenced by magic and alchemy (Lee, 1973).
Another important movement was also the Confucianism, a movement that sometimes is believed to be a religion, but, according to Berling (2014), it is a movement closer to ethical philosophy: to expand our sense of justice and a proper way to be in society. Confucianism uses a set of behaviors to make a well relation between human beings. If people acted in the correct way, society could function without a single problem. One of the most quoted sayings from Confucius could explain his vision about making the right thing (Berling, 2014):</p>
<p>Only when things are investigated is knowledge extended.<br>Only when knowledge is extended are thoughts sincere.<br>Only when thoughts are sincere are minds rectified.<br>Only when minds are rectified are the characters of persons cultivated.<br>Only when character is cultivated are our families regulated.<br>Only when families are regulated are states well governed.<br>Only when states are well governed is there peace in the world.</p>
<p>Another of the influences was the Buddhism, from India. Buddhism was founded by Siddharta Gautama, which is referred as the Buddha. The mother of Buddah, Queen Maya, gave birth to Buddah standing down a tree and he was born by a side of the Queen. It is common that, in these legends, the birth of people is in extraordinary circumstances, like, in Christianity, Jesus was born from a virgin women or, in Aztec religion, Huitzilopochtli’s mother got pregnant from feathers. Through prophecies Siddharta’s father knew that his son was meant to be a spiritual leader. Siddharta was living inside a palace and when he saw the world and all its problems, he decided, at the age of 29, to live a more simple life and he renounced to materialism (Schneider, 2008).&nbsp;
Buddah is translated as “the awakened one” or “the enlightened”: the one who can live a real life, like if everything before was a dream and then, in the Buddhism, you finally wake up to discover what is real. Vail (2014) says that, nowadays, Buddhism is not very common in India, but it is one of the most popular religions in Asia. All of these systems were very important to the Chinese culture and influenced in a great way the art of its time.
It is curious to note, as you have seen in topics before, ideas from different places are often repeated, even if the civilizations lived in opposites sides of the Earth. You found here the idea of life as an illusion: everything you see or touch is like an imaginary world. The idea that life is a dream has been used a lot also in literature.</p>
<p><strong>Painting</strong>
One of the first important work written about Chinese painting was “Six Canons of Painting” by Hsieh Ho. In his book, Ho writes about six elements that he uses to criticize, judge or talk about a painting. It has been translated in many languages, but you’re going to read the versions of Acker &amp; Soper quoted by Lee (1973). These are the six cannons that offer a general vision of a painting:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Animation through spirit consonance:</strong>
This is the most important one. It represents the “spirit” of the painting, what it is transmitted. It is interesting to look at how Lee says something translated as “animation through spirit”. Word “anima” in latin means “soul”, so, when you look at the painting it needs to have a “soul”, like a message that the artist needs to say. If the painting does not transmit any “energy” or does not have any creativity, this element would not be completed.</li>
<li><strong>Structural method in the use of the brush:</strong>
The way in which the painter uses the brush is important to define the style. You could talk here about the lines, the way they are portrayed and what they show. Calligraphy was also very important to Chinese culture because written word was a tradition, so weak or strong strokes were judged as part of the individual personality of the painting. </li>
<li><strong>Fidelity to the object in portraying forms:</strong>
It refers if the object the artist is painting looks “real” or not. So, as you can infer, paintings tend to be more natural and reflect life.</li>
<li><strong>Conformity to kind in applying colors:</strong>
Colors and its variations should also have an intern logic. It was used mostly in a decorative sense. According to Acker, artists could play a little bit with the colors, but staying in the realms of the naturalism.</li>
<li><strong>Proper planning in the placing of elements:</strong>
To put the elements in a way they represent an order inside the painting. The elements of composition, like unity or balance, must be portrayed.</li>
<li><strong>Transmission of the experience of the past in making copies:</strong>
Chinese culture venerates the past and reverences what have been done before instead of worrying more for the future. When an artist copied a painting from the past, they practice their skills and study the greatness of the masters. Copying a painting was a way of learning.</li>
</ol>
<p>As you can see, the law canons have a very subjective approach to the painting.<br>Somehow it is possible to imagine or infer if the elements in a painting are well portrayed, but it is difficult to say something definitive about a painting because time could change your perspective of things. It may be thought that the avant-garde movements or the abstract art do not make sense because they do not pretend to portray real things, but to reimagine them.
You have seen these canons or elements because a lot of the first paintings reflect them, for example, the Admonitions Scroll which was attributed to Ku K’ai-chih (c. A.D. 344-c. 406) and demonstrates the behavior of ladies in the palace. It is one of the most famous Chinese paintings, especially the last scene, called “Instructress Writing Down Her Admonitions for the Benefit of Two Young Ladies” that shows exactly that. From that collection you can see also “Landscape with Hunter” that shows a hunter with a crossbow and a mountain, and the “Bed Scene” which portrait the emperor visiting to his mistress.</p>
<p><strong>4.2 Persian</strong>
Persian civilization was at the east of Mesopotamia, where today is Iran. That region was called the Fars. In the sixth century, Persians were a very strong empire, commanded by the King Cyrus. The empire reached the Indus Valley (a civilization that was near the Indus River, extended from Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India), Northern Greece, Central Asia and Egypt (German, 2014).
According to Fichner-Rathus (2007), Persian art consists on big palaces with simple designs. Among the things that they used to portrait were animals like birds and ibexes (a kind of goat with big horns). Usually, they were showed in vessels or in rhytons.&nbsp;
The columns from Persians were modelled after Greek columns, according to Essential Humanities (2013). In a capital (the superior part of a column) from a Hall of the palace of King Artaxerxes (available now at the Louvre Museum in Paris), you can observe a lot of the motifs (a theme or a pattern that you can observe) from the Persians, this is often called Persian animal capital. It has an animal (the bulls), a volute (spiral ornament) and a simple design (the bulls does not look exactly as bulls, but as an abstract version of it).
In architecture, we can find buildings supported by columns, especially in the Achaemenid Empire (the first Persian Empire, from 550-330 BC), like in the Apadana Palace, which capitals were made with animals like bulls and lions. On the other hand, Empires like the Sassanid (224 BC to 651 BC) used arched constructions, more common with the Romans.
Essential Humanities (2013) says that one of the ways in which the Persian sculpture survived was through reliefs. What is a relief? A relief is when a figure stand out from a flat surface, such as a wall. It had two different forms: one very stylized, near to the style from Mesopotamia, and other one more realistic. You can find a mix of this two forms in all the representations of the Persian culture.
A Persian sculpture is located in the Shapur cave, where it was the city of Bishapur, which is now in ruins. In this place there is the statue of a king called Shapur I, who ruled in the Sasanid Empire (that lasted from 224 AC to 651 AC). It is called a “colossal” statue because is huge: its height is 6.7 m. The arms and legs of the statue are lost, but the right hand is in the waist. In the head of the king there is a crown: his face has a powerful expression, and we can look at his long hair, big mustache and beard.
It is a big contrast to look at this gigantic statues and then at some statuettes (a small statue) and rythons (container for drinking or for pouring liquids). At the British Museum (Curtis, 2000), for example, it is registered a “Cast silver statuette from the Oxus treasure”, retrieved from the Achaemenid period. Curtis mentions how the statuette is wearing a head-dress (from Persian influence) but it is naked (from Greek influence), so you can look at how the art was represented from both points of view (as in the Greek and Roman influence for the architecture).
A Persian ryhton can be found at the Louvre museum: they got registered a “Rython (drinking horn) with gazelle protome” in the Department of Near Eastern Antiquities. It was also from the Achaemenid Empire. Nancie (n.d.) describes the artwork in the following words:
<em>The fluting is finished with a narrow gilt metal band decorated with strips alternating with inverted lotus flowers. The rim is smooth and flared. It once had antlers slotted into two small protuberances. Most of the details of the animal's body are engraved except for its eyes and eyelids.</em></p>
<p><strong>4.3 Hinduism</strong>
According to Dehejia (2014) from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, people on Earth, in the Hindu perspective of things, have some goals that need to achieve or to look for. Let’s explain some of these four concepts to understand more about Hinduism and the further development of his art.</p>
<p><strong>Dharma:</strong> The meaning of this word is “natural word”, meaning the natural order of the things. Is there something that organize and order all of the things? That’s what the dharma means. Dharma is also about searching for peace and harmony, and to have integrity and righteousness with life: to live in a correct and ethical way, according to your values. Also, it can refer to the teachings of Buddah, “the awakened one”, as you read in the topic before (O’Brien, 2014).
<strong>Artha:</strong> Artha means “wealth” or “property”. It refers to the search of having material things. Artha is important for living: it is obvious that human beings need to have some superficial things in order to survive. It is important to notice that dharma is always more important, and artha should be only a medium to achieve the dharma (Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2014).
<strong>Kama:</strong> Kama was the god of love in the Indian mythology. This word refers to the emotions that we feel on Earth, making us attached to this life. It also can be used to express a love in a sensual or sexual way (like the written work of the “Kama Sutra”, written by Vātsyāyana, in where love and sexual nature are explored). Kama could be also a problem to reach the enlightenment, because desire can chain us and we can be enslaved by it (Cline, 2014).
<strong>Moksha:</strong> The definition of this word is “freedom” and it means a liberation from the constant cycle of the death and the “samsara” (the soul that tries to find the freedom from the things that he does in the past, the karma). It also means a moment in which we know ourselves (Olivelle, 2014).</p>
<p>It is fundamental to know about these four concepts to understand about Hinduism. You can see this as a code to live a life and it can apply to anybody: from the desire of doing the right things to the liberation or the reward. According to Dehejia (2014), a Hindu temple have sculptures that reflect the four goals of life (with a biggest focus on the moksha part). That’s why art is not only religious in temples, but sensuous.
At the temples, images would represent a deity in various states or portraying different moments. Dehejia (2014) offers some examples: in a temple dedicated to Vishnu (often represented with four arms and in a human form) is common you found some of the different incarnations that he suffered (as Mastya, Kurma, Parasurama or Ram, among others); if you find a temple from Shiva, maybe you can found in combative feasts or if it is dedicated to Devi, or the Great Goddess, she might be fighting against different demons.
You can find at the Metropolitan Museum of Art some of the most important sculptures from the Hinduism. There is the "Standing four-armed Vishnu” (2006), which is carved in a typical Indian way, with the god portrayed with a round face. Vishnu, as you have been said previously, was portrayed in many forms (or avatars, like an incarnation or a representation of someone else). He is holding things like a war discus, a conch and a battle mace. One of the four hands is missing but it is believed that hand would carry an orb that symbolizes earth.
But definitely, one of the most famous and representative statue is the one of Shiva, called “Shiva as Lord of Dance (Nataraja)” (2006). In this sculpture from 68.3 cm of height, you can find Shiva dancing at the center of the universe, in presence of other gods. He shows that he creates, preserves and destroys. His left leg is raised which represent a refuge for the soul in troubles that can reach salvation. The circle around Shiva represents the boundaries of cosmos.</p>
